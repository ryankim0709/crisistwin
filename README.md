# CrisisTwin

A Cal Hacks project exploring disaster response and evacuation planning through an interactive digital twin.

CrisisTwin will let emergency planners test how fire spread, road closures, evacuation demand, and resource decisions interact before comparing possible responses.

## Initial demo scope

- Visualize a wildfire scenario and a surrounding road network.
- Simulate community evacuation demand and traffic bottlenecks.
- Inject changes such as a wind shift, bridge closure, or simultaneous departures.
- Compare evacuation strategies, departure times, and shelter assignments.
- Show assumptions, uncertainty, and which missing observations could change a decision.

## Project status

Repository initialized; application code, stack, and data integrations are still to be selected. The items above describe the intended prototype, not implemented features.

This is an experimental planning simulator. Its outputs are not operational evacuation instructions; any future resident guidance should require approval by the responsible authority.

## Development

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ryankim0709/crisistwin.git
cd crisistwin
```

Runtime setup instructions will be added when the application scaffold is chosen. Keep API keys and local credentials out of Git; document required variable names in an `.env.example` file when integrations are added.

## Working with coding agents

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains the shared engineering, collaboration, verification, and simulation rules. Read it before starting work and keep team decisions in the repository so both partners' agents see the same context.

Codex uses `AGENTS.md` directly. Cursor, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot have small adapters that point to the same file. Change shared guidance in `AGENTS.md` to keep the tools aligned.

For concurrent work, use separate branches and checkouts/worktrees and agree on shared interfaces before editing overlapping files. Use the pull request template to hand off changes and verification results.

## Concept background

The project grew out of [this planning conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/6adc0b53-b864-83e8-84f7-8560e24d2a15).
